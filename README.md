# NGAWest2-ground-motion-crawler
This Python script automates the download of ground motion data files from the NGA West 2 database. It extracts record information from a flatfile, logs into the website, navigates the interface, selects options, downloads files as a ZIP archive, unzips and organizes the acceleration data into a structured DataFrame.
